# GitLab CI/CD Documentation

## Overview

GitLab is a powerful platform used for **Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**, version control, and monitoring. This document provides detailed information on how to create and manage pipelines in GitLab, along with various other features and functionalities.

## Creating a Pipeline in GitLab

To create a pipeline in GitLab, follow these steps:

### 1. Create a .gitlab-ci.yml File
- The pipeline configuration is defined in a file named `.gitlab-ci.yml` located in the root directory of your repository.
- This configuration file is based on YAML syntax.

### Explanation of Commands

#### `stages`
- **Definition**: Defines the different stages of the pipeline.
- **Usage**: Lists the stages in the order they should be executed.
- **Example**:

```yaml
stages:
  - build
  - test
  - deploy
```

#### `script`
- **Definition**: Specifies the commands to be executed by the runner.
- **Usage**: Contains the actual shell commands to run for each job.
- **Example**:

```yaml
build_job:
  stage: build
  script:
    - echo "Building the application"
```

#### `stage`
- **Definition**: Assigns a specific stage to a job.
- **Usage**: Helps to organize jobs into stages.
- **Example**:

```yaml
build_job:
  stage: build
  script:
    - echo "Building the application"
```

#### `artifacts`
- **Definition**: Defines the files or directories to be passed between jobs and stored as artifacts.
- **Usage**: Specifies the paths to the files or directories.
- **Example**:

```yaml
build_job:
  stage: build
  script:
    - echo "Compiling the application"
    - mkdir -p output
    - echo "Binary file" > output/binary
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - output/
```

#### `when`
- **Definition**: Specifies when a job should run.
- **Usage**: Can be set to `on_success`, `on_failure`, `always`, or `manual`.
- **Example**:

```yaml
deploy_job:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - echo "Deploying the application"
  when: manual
```

#### `image`
- **Definition**: Defines the Docker image to be used for the job.
- **Usage**: Specifies the Docker image in which the job runs.
- **Example**:

```yaml
image: python:latest

stages:
  - test

test_job:
  stage: test
  script:
    - python --version
    - echo "Running Python tests"
```

#### `variables`
- **Definition**: Defines custom environment variables for jobs.
- **Usage**: Used to specify variables that can be accessed within scripts.
- **Example**:

```yaml
variables:
  TEST_VAR: "This is a test variable"
```

### 2. Artifacts
- Artifacts are files generated by jobs and can be shared across subsequent jobs.

```yaml
build_job:
  stage: build
  script:
    - echo "Compiling the application"
    - mkdir -p output
    - echo "Binary file" > output/binary
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - output/
```

### 3. Environment Variables
- Environment variables can be added in the GitLab UI under **Settings > CI/CD > Variables**.
- GitLab provides predefined CI/CD variables that can be used directly in scripts. For example, `$CI_COMMIT_AUTHOR`.

```yaml
test_job:
  stage: test
  script:
    - echo "Testing by $CI_COMMIT_AUTHOR"
```

### 4. Email Notifications
- GitLab sends email notifications when a pipeline fails or is fixed. The email includes project details, commit ID, author, etc.

### 5. Scheduling Jobs
- Jobs can be scheduled to run automatically or manually. The `when: manual` keyword is used to specify manual execution.

```yaml
deploy_job:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - echo "Deploying the application"
  when: manual
```

### 6. Importing Projects from GitHub
- You can import projects or repositories from GitHub to GitLab. Go to **New project > Import project** and follow the instructions.

### 7. Using Docker Images
- The `image` keyword is used to define the Docker image for the job.

```yaml
image: python:latest

stages:
  - test

test_job:
  stage: test
  script:
    - python --version
    - echo "Running Python tests"
```

## Example .gitlab-ci.yml File

Here is a comprehensive example of a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file:

```yaml
image: python:latest

stages:
  - build
  - test
  - deploy

variables:
  TEST_VAR: "This is a test variable"

build_job:
  stage: build
  script:
    - echo "Building the application"
    - mkdir -p output
    - echo "Binary file" > output/binary
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - output/

test_job:
  stage: test
  script:
    - echo "Testing the application"
    - echo "Testing by $CI_COMMIT_AUTHOR"

deploy_job:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - echo "Deploying the application"
  when: manual
```
