Configuration management system

uses push mechanism, agentless, uses YAML manisfest, easy to use, support linux(SSH protocol); windows(winRM protocol). uses Python

how to install ansible: easy way use package manager of the linux distro. eg for ubuntu: sudo apt-get install ansible
to generate ssh key: ssh-keygen

keys will be used to configure passwodless authentication with target machine. the target machine should have the public key of the main machine in its /root/.ssh/autorised_keys. This could be in root or home. 
never to share private key with anyone, if needed to connect use public key.
In azure while creating vm's we can use the same public key on all servers.

check ansible version: ansible --version
Ansible playbooks are like shell scripts, they are the files.

inventory file: file which store IP address of target servers.
by default ansible stores the inventory file in /etc/ansible/hosts , but we can create and store inventory file in any location we want.
