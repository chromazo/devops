tools: Puppet, Chef, Ansible(Redhat managed, most used)

why Ansible??

puppet - 
--- pull mechanism
--- Master-slave/master-agent
--- Puppet language

ansible - 
--- push mechanism --> write playbook on one device and push it on all instances
--- agentless mechanism
--- inventory/Dynamic inventory
--- YAML
--- windows/Linux support
cons: debugging, issues with performance, windows
