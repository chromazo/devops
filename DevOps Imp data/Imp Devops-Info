##  Configuration management

tools: Puppet, Chef, Ansible(Redhat managed, most used)

why Ansible??
Puppet - 
--- pull mechanism
--- Master-slave/master-agent
--- Puppet language

Ansible - 
--- push mechanism --> write playbook on one device and push it on all instances
--- agentless mechanism
--- inventory/Dynamic inventory
--- YAML
--- can write own Ansible modules
--- windows/Linux support
cons: debugging, issues with performance, windows

Interview questions
- what is the programming language which ansible use --> python
- does ansible support windows, Linux? yes supports both windows(protocol - win RM), Linux(protocol - SSH) 
- difference between puppet/chef and Ansible or why we chose Ansible over other configuration management tools
- is ansible push or pull mechanism --> Push mechanism
- what language ansible uses to write playbook - YAML
- Does Ansible supports all cloud provider? cloud provider doesn't matter, we require public access/SSH connection is allowed from ansible to the machine(win RM in windows)
