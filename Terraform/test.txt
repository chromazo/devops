AWS CFT, azure ARM, etc --> Infrastructure as code (IaC)

Terraform --> API as code
create terraform scripts and it will help automate any provider tasks (aws,azure,etc) using their api's
-- easily migrate from one platform to another with minimal changes

API (application interface) --> to programmatically talk with any application

Advantages of terraform
-- Manage any Infrastructure
-- Track your infrastructure
-- automate changes
-- standardized configuration
-- collaborate

latest terraform version: Terraform v1.9.5

Terraform files are called HCL((HashiCorp Configuration Language) files

## if there are multiple terraform files in a directory, when we run "terraform plan' command it will read all the files and will provide us with output of each files
the files are loaded in alphabetical order

We use "output" block to print data
output <lable> {
    value = ""
}

we use "variable" block to assign a variable
Below command takes input from user and assigns it to a variable "username"
variable username {}

below command is used to print text along with variable data
output printName {
    value = "Hello, ${var.username}"
}

define a variable while running "terraform plan" command not taking input from user --> terraform plan - "username=John"

Terrform takes input from user for a variable if it is not set, if a value is provided, input from user will not be taken
eg:
variable name {
	default = "John"
}
here the default value of variable name is set to "John", hence no input will be taken for name variable
