This folder is created for Bash scripting. 30/05/2024

List of system variables used: $USER, $PATH, $SHELL
To get all the environment variables we can use "env" command

It is best practice to store scripts in /usr/local/bin/
Also to modify the permission of the script so only autorised user can run the script (mostly root user)
